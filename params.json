(and I choose JSON) so I decided to\r\nrewrite old stuff using new tools\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\nyou can see how it works by input following in command line\r\n```sh\r\n$ python jconfigpy -c -i ../example/config.json\r\n```\r\n\r\nor you can load configuration to generate header file and resolve dependencies\r\n```sh\r\n$ python jconfigpy.py -s -i ../configs/config -t ../example/config.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Feature\r\n```\r\n1. JSON based configuration script (ease of use)\r\n2. Keep source code (even Makefile) simple (good readability)\r\n3. dependencies resolution (git)\r\n3. Adding new module or dependency is simple and isolated from other source tree (improve project scalability)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Required\r\n```\r\n1. python 2.7\r\n2. GNU Make utility\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Licnes\r\n```\r\nBSD-2\r\n```",
